# SpaceBearsFA19
Final Project for team Space Bears in ATLS4040: Game Development

Furthering the Concept 10/30/19

We discussed as a team the basic direction that we wanted our game to go in. This included our Design Values and our Core Mechanics.

Design Values:
- Teamwork / Coordination
- Challenging Puzzles
- Cuteness
- Fun and Brain Bendy Situations

Game Mechanics:
- Physics Altering Musical Instruments
- Spatial Puzzles
- Traps and Obstacles

After setting these goals for the development of our game we dug into some other aspects of the game that still needed fleshing out like player abilities, obstacles and world items, our core instrument ideas and how the instruments interact with the world or other objects. 

The basic player abilities we want include walking/running, a short jump, using their instruments & potentially picking up objects or interacting with objects. Other abilities like sprinting or crouching probably won't impact how our players will interact with the game so they aren't immediately necessary. 

Another topic we tossed around was the size of the characters, at the moment it looks like the main 4 characters will be Bears so their height and width probably wonâ€™t change between each character. We discussed having different animals and each of them being a different size, but we decided that changing each of their sizes would impact how they interacted with the platformer and added a layer of complexity to our lives that we probably don't need. 

The obstacles and items we want to implement include lasers, buttons, doors, switches, portals, boxes and electricity. This is just our initial list.

The instruments are probably the most exciting part of our game and we have semi-narrowed it down to 4 concepts. We want to include instruments that change time/speed, size, gravity/rotation and forces. This is also our initial list for this and probably will get revised as we home in on the specifics and limitations of each instrument. 

One other aspect that we still need to discuss further are the interactions between the instruments and the thing that they are affecting. Can you change the size of a player from anywhere on the map or do you have to be standing next to them or do you have to be within line of sight? The same questions apply to interacting with an object and there are similar but still to be discovered questions about interacting with the world.

There are still many questions to iron out, but we are on the way to answering them!



Initial Ideation 10/23/19

The dust has settled from our huge class brainstorm and a team has emerged. Team Space Bears!
The working design includes a CO-OP Animal Astronaut Magical Musical Puzzle Adventure Game. Just that. Potentially astronaut bears but it is still getting ironed out. We want to create a visually and complexly simple game with some interesting mechanical depth... if that exists.
Our ideas now involve a multi-player game with each player coining a unique ability through the power of magical space instruments. Ideas include:
  - The Time Trumpet
  - The Size Saxophone
  - The Gravity Guitar
  - The Speed Synth
  - Rotation Recorder
  - More on the way!
  
These abilities and instruments will affect the way all of the players experience the environment of the game. 
There is room at the moment for a puzzle and external fighting format which will combine the characteristics of the instruments and characters with a level-based puzzle design. 
We want to use some simple controllers for the players to use and some set of shared resources which may include a number of uses for the instruments per level.
Our initial goals for the project include 5 multiplayer levels, one Boss level, and one for funzies bonus level. 
Space Bears OUT!
