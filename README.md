# Myusics 
# By Team: Space Bears!

Check out our Co-Op Multiplayer Space Puzzle Adventure: Myusics! With the help of some friends, your fellow animal astronaughts, and your trusty physics-altering musical instruments, you must find your way through each satellite, spaceship, exoplanet and more. Will it be the Time Halting Trumpet that frees you from the ship or the Gravity Throwing Guitar that saves the day? Players will need to combine both their wits and some sick beats to get out of this one. 

Coming to probably this git repo soon!
