# Welcome to The Space Bears
By Team: Space Bears!

Check out our Co-Op Multiplayer Space Puzzle Adventure: A Space Bear Adventure! With the help of some friends, your fellow animal astronauts, and your trusty physics-altering musical instruments you must find your way through each room of your crashed spaceship to assess the damage. Will it be the Time-Halting-Trumpet that frees you from the room or the Sizing-Sazophone that saves the day? Players will need to combine both their wits and some sick beats to get out of this one. 

Coming to probably this git repo soon!

Team Members:  Dylan Turner, Zayna Sheikh & Damien Howard
