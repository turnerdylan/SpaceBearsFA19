# SpaceBearsFA19
Final Project for team Space Bears in ATLS4040: Game Development

Initial Ideation 10/23/19
The dust has settled from our huge class brainstorm and a team has emerged. Team Space Bears!
The working design includes a CO-OP Animal Astronaught Magical Musical Puzzle Adventure Game. Just that. Potentially astronaught bears but it is still getting ironed out. We want to create a visually and complexly simple game with some interesting mechanical depth... if that exists.
Our ideas now involve a multi player game with each player coining a unique ability through the oiwer of magical space instruments. Ideas include:
  - The Time Trumpet
  - The Size Saxophone
  - The Gravity Guitar
  - The Speed Synth
  - More on the way!
  
These abilities and intruments will affect the way all of the players experience the environment of the game. 
There is room at the moment for a puzzle and external fighting format which will combine the characteristics of the instruments and characters with a level based puzzle design. 
We want to use some simple controllers for the players to use and some set of shared resources which may include a number of uses for the instruments per level.
Our initial goals for the project include 5 multiplayer levels, one Boss level, and one for funzies bonus level. 
Space Bears OUT!
